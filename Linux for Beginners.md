### What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system that is based on the Unix operating system. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

Open source means that the source code of the operating system is available to the public. This allows anyone to modify the original code, customise it, and distribute the new operating system to potential users.
