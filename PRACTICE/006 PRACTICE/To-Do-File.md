# Bash Script Operations

## Task - 20-09-2024

### Overview

This project includes a series of Bash scripts that perform essential file and text manipulation tasks, along with basic system checks. These tasks are designed to improve scripting proficiency and cover a broad range of operations used in shell scripting.

### Tasks Performed

Below is the list of tasks performed, along with a brief description:

✅ 1. **Simulate a Simple Calculator**  
A shell program that takes two numbers and a mathematical operator (+, -, \*, /) as input and performs the specified operation, returning the result.

✅ 2. **Count Specific Elements in a Text File**  
A shell program that counts the following items in a given text file:

- Number of vowels
- Number of blank spaces
- Number of characters
- Number of symbols
- Number of lines

✅ 3. **Count Unique Email Domains**  
A shell script that reads a file containing a list of email addresses (one per line) and counts how many unique domains (e.g., `gmail.com`, `yahoo.com`) are present.

✅ 4. **Sort Lines in a Text File**  
A shell script that reads the contents of a text file, sorts the lines in alphabetical order, and writes the sorted lines into a new file called `sorted_output.txt`.

✅ 5. **Check File Permissions**  
A shell script that takes a filename as an argument and checks if the file is readable, writable, and executable, displaying the results accordingly.

### Summary

These scripts demonstrate common use cases for Bash scripting, ranging from arithmetic operations and file processing to system administration checks. Each task highlights fundamental Bash features such as conditional logic, loops, and file I/O, which are crucial for automating repetitive tasks and ensuring system efficiency.
