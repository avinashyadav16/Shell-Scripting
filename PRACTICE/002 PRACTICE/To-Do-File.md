# Bash Script Operations

## PRACTICE TASK - 23-08-2024

## Tasks Performed:

✅ 1. **Show Date and Time**

- The script starts by displaying the current date and time using the `date` command.

✅ 2. **List All Files and Directories**

- It lists all the files and directories in the current working directory with the `ls` command.

✅ 3. **Print a Statement**

- A simple message "Hello World!" is printed using the `echo` command.

✅ 4. **Display System Variables**

- The script displays the Bash version (`$BASH_VERSION`) and the current working directory (`$PWD`).

✅ 5. **User-defined Variables**

- A greeting message and a name are stored in variables and printed using the `echo` command.

✅ 6. **Arithmetic Operations**

- The script performs arithmetic operations using three different methods:
  1. Using `$((expression))` syntax.
  2. Using `((expression))` syntax.
  3. Storing values in variables and performing operations.

✅ 7. **Conditional Operator**

- The script reads a number from the user and checks if it's greater than a given number.

✅ 8. **Comparing Two Numbers by using conditional statements**

- It prompts the user to enter two numbers and checks which one is greater.

✅ 9. **Arrays**

- The script creates an array of programming languages, performs various operations such as displaying all elements, accessing a specific element, showing indices, and updating an element.

✅ 10. **Sum of First n Numbers by using loops**

- The script calculates the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, where `n` is provided by the user.

## Summary

This script demonstrates various Bash scripting techniques, including working with system and user-defined variables, performing arithmetic operations, using conditional statements, manipulating arrays, and reading input from the user.
