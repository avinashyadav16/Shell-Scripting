# Bash Script Operations

## Practice Task - 13-09-2024

### Overview

This project includes a series of Bash scripts that perform various operations commonly used in shell scripting. These tasks were designed to strengthen scripting skills and cover a wide range of fundamental concepts in Bash programming.

### Tasks Performed

Below is the list of tasks performed along with a brief description:

✅ 1. **Translate All Characters to Lowercase**  
A script that takes a text file as input and converts all characters in the file to lowercase.

✅ 2. **Combine Three Text Files and Display Word Count**  
A script that combines any three text files into a single file (in the order they are provided as arguments) and displays the total word count of the combined file.

✅ 3. **Separate Even and Odd Numbered Lines in a File**  
A script that, given a file name, writes the even-numbered lines to a file named `evenfile` and odd-numbered lines to a file named `oddfile`.

✅ 4. **Delete All Even Numbered Lines in a File**  
A script that deletes all the even-numbered lines from a given text file.

✅ 5. **Display Username, Date, Time, and Logged In Users**  
A script called `hello` that outputs:

- Your username.
- The current time and date.
- The list of users currently logged on.
- A line of asterisks (`*********`) after each section.

✅ 6. **Count the Number of Files in Each Subdirectory**  
A script that counts the number of files in each subdirectory of the current directory.

✅ 7. **Display a File in 15-line Chunks**  
A script that acts like the `more` command. It prompts the user for a file name and displays 15 lines of the file at a time. The next 15 lines are displayed only when the user presses any key.

✅ 8. **Count English Articles (a, an, the) in a Text File**  
A script that counts the occurrences of English articles (`a`, `an`, `the`) in a given text file.

✅ 9. **Replace All Occurrences of a Character in a String**  
A script that replaces each occurrence of a specified character in a string with another set of characters and displays the number of replacements made.

✅ 10. **Concatenate Two Strings and Display Length**  
A shell program that concatenates two strings provided as input and displays the resultant string along with its total length.

### Summary

These scripts demonstrate a range of basic to intermediate Bash scripting techniques, including string manipulation, file handling, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and loops. Each task showcases practical use cases for shell scripting in automating everyday tasks, enhancing efficiency, and simplifying system administration processes.
